# Unexpected Behavior with CSS `calc()` Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The problem stems from relying on parent element dimensions that are either not explicitly defined or are themselves calculated.

## Bug Description

The `calc()` function is powerful for dynamic sizing, but unexpected results may occur if the parent element's dimensions are undefined or calculated indirectly.  This can lead to layout inconsistencies across different browsers or screen sizes.

## Bug Solution

The solution is to ensure that the parent element has explicitly defined dimensions.  If this is not possible, alternative layout techniques should be considered to avoid depending entirely on the `calc()` function's dynamic behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the inconsistent width of the inner element. 
4. Open `bugSolution.html` in your browser to see the corrected layout.
